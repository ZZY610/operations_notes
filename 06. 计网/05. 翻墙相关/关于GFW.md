# 关于GFW
### whats GFW？
GFW stands for "Great Firewall of China", which is a network surveillance and censorship system implemented by the Chinese government to control and restrict access to certain websites and online content.

The main functions of GFW include:

Network filtering and blocking: GFW can filter and block access to specific websites, IP addresses, keywords, and other online content, restricting access to certain information.

Traffic monitoring and censorship: GFW can monitor and censor network traffic to prevent the spread of sensitive information and inappropriate content online.

DNS tampering: GFW can tamper with and alter Domain Name System (DNS) to restrict access to certain websites and services.

The implementation of GFW has had a significant impact on the development and use of the internet in China. On one hand, it has effectively limited access to sensitive information and content, protecting national security and stability. On the other hand, it has restricted freedom of speech and information, affecting internet innovation and development.
### how to cross the block of GFW？
Crossing the block of GFW, or bypassing internet censorship in general, can be a challenging task as governments and ISPs are constantly implementing new measures to restrict access to information online. However, there are several methods that can be used to bypass GFW and access blocked content:

* Virtual Private Network (VPN): A VPN is an encrypted network connection that allows users to access the internet through a remote server. By using a VPN, users can mask their internet traffic and bypass GFW restrictions.

* Proxy servers: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the user's computer and the internet. By using a proxy server, users can access blocked content by masking their IP address and location.

* Tor: The Tor network is a decentralized network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously. By using Tor, users can bypass GFW restrictions and access blocked content.

* DNS changing: DNS (Domain Name System) servers convert website names into IP addresses. By changing DNS servers, users can bypass GFW restrictions and access blocked content.

* Shadowsocks: Shadowsocks is an encrypted proxy server that can bypass GFW restrictions and provide access to blocked content.

It's important to note that using these methods to bypass GFW restrictions may be illegal or against government regulations in some countries, and can result in serious consequences. Therefore, it's important to research the legality of using these methods in your country before attempting to use them.
